## üéØ ATS COMPATIBILITY SCORE
Score: 75/100
Fair match - Resume has potential but needs improvements

## ‚úÖ MATCHING SKILLS & KEYWORDS
- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Git
- RESTful APIs
- Problem-solving (via synonym match)
- Eagerness to learn (via synonym match)

## ‚ùå MISSING KEYWORDS
- MERN Stack (explicit mention)
- Express.js
- Junior MERN Stack Developer
- Intern

## üîç EXPERIENCE LEVEL ANALYSIS
The job requires a Junior MERN Stack Developer Intern, but the candidate is a Senior Software Engineer with 6 years of experience. While this is a mismatch, the candidate's strong technical skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB make them capable of performing the role, though their seniority may suggest overqualification.

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Explicitly mention "MERN Stack" and "Express.js" in the resume.
2. Highlight projects using the MERN stack to demonstrate relevant experience.
3. Include a statement about enthusiasm for learning and adapting to new roles.
4. Tailor the resume to focus on relevant technical skills rather than senior-level achievements.

## üìä OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The score of 75/100 reflects a fair match due to strong technical skills but is reduced by the experience level mismatch and missing explicit keywords. Tailoring the resume to the junior role will improve the score.
